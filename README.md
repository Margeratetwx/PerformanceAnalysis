# Performance Analysis
This project is about designing database of a department to analyse the performance of each employee.

Below is the image of the database that I have designed
![Slide1](https://github.com/Margeratetwx/PerformanceAnalysis/assets/137268542/20d5e44d-1be6-4f7c-bf1d-a310c1e1e670)

In Performance Analysis Database.sql, there are two parts:

-Part I is about creating database and tables

-Part II is about some analysis I have made


In insert values.sql is the synthetic data that have been randomly created, all the data in this sql file is fake

The purpose of generating synthetic data is just for testing the database and also the analysis.
